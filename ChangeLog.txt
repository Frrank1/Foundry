This file contains the change log for the Cognitive Foundry.

Changes since last release:


Release 3.0.3 (2010-12-22):
* Common Core:
  * UnivariateStatisticsUtil: Weighted computations handle negative weights by
    using absolute values to fix bug.

Release 3.0.2 (2010-12-15):
* Common Core:
  * ValueMapper: Added create() method.
  * UnivariateStatisticsUtil: Addressed numerical instability in one-pass
    variance calculations.
  * DefaultNamedValue: Added create() methods.
  * Added ArgumentChecker utility class.
  * Added KeyValuePair interface and DefaultKeyValuePair implementation.
* Learning Core:
  * AdaBoost: Generalized generics.
  * BaggingCategorizerLearner: Will create a new Random if null.
  * WeightedBinaryEnsemble: Added generic for the member type.
  * IVotingCategorizerLearner: Performance improvements, added vote histogram
    factory.
  * HiddenMarkovModel: Made computeObservationsLikelihoods public.
  * ParallelHiddenMarkovModel: Added copy constructor.
  * Added online perceptron and voted perceptron implementations.
  * Added primal estimated sub-gradient SVM learner.
  * AbstractDecisionTreeLearner: Performance tweaks.
  * AbstractDecisionTreeNode: Added parent field.
  * AbstractVectorThresholdMaximumGainLearner: Fixed corner-case bug.
  * CategorizationTreeLearner: Added maximum depth parameter and cleaned up
    implementation.
  * CategorizationTreeNode: Support of parent field.
  * DecisionTreeNode: Added getParent(), getDepth(), and getTreeSize() methods.
  * RegressionTreeLearner: Added maximum depth parameter.
  * RegressionTreeNode: Support of parent field.
  * DatasetUtil: Added splitOnOutput method.
  * ConstantEvaluator: Added create method.
  * LinearBinaryCategorizer: Now allows null weight vector (evaluates to 0.0).
  * VectorElementThresholdCategorizer: Added toString().
  * AbstractDataHistogram: Now contains default implementations of getFraction()
    and addAll().
  * DataHistogram: Minor refactoring to be more consistent with other
    statistics distributions. In particular, getDomain() is to be used instead
    of getValues(), which was removed. Moved many of the methods that were in
    the implementation class into the interface.
  * DiscreteSamplingUtil: New utility class for sampling discrete objects.
  * ScalarSummaryStatistics: Bug fix.
  * MapBasedDataHistogram: Reworked with changes to DataHistogram. New PMF,
    learner, and factory implementations.
  * UnivariateGaussian: Learner classes generic updated to be a
    UnivariateGaussian.PDF, which it was already returning.
  * Added YuleSimonDistribution distribution class.
  * KolmogorovSmirnovConfidence: Fixed infinite loop with given NaNs.

Release 3.0.1 (2010-10-15):
* Common Core:
  * Added ArrayUtil class.
  * MultivariateStatisticsUtil: computeMean changed to accept Iterable instead
    of Collection.
  * Permutation: Added reorder method.
* Learning Core:
  * DirichletProcessClustering: Performance improvements.
  * Cluster: Made CloneableSerializable.
  * DefaultCluster: Now extends AbstractCloneableSerializable.
  * AbstractClusterHierarchyNode:: Now extends AbstractCloneableSerializable.
  * gov.sandia.cognition.learning.function.cost: Added AbstractCostFunction,
    KolmogorovSmirnocDivergence, NegativeLogLikelihood, and
    ParallelNegativeLogLikelihood.
  * SequantialMinimalOptimization: Added an initial implementatio of the
    algorithm.
  * WeightedEuclideanDistance: Added a weighted Euclidean distance metric.
  * Added EstimableDistribution interface.
  * AbstractMarkovChainMonteCarlo: Now keeps track of previous parameter.
  * DirichletProcessMixtureModel: Performance improvements.
  * ParallelDirichletProcessMixtureModel: Performance improvements.
  * MultivariateGaussianMeanBayesianEstimator: Update now optimized for case of
    a list instead of a single update.
  * MultivariateGaussianMeanCovarianceBayesianEstimator: Optimizations for case
    of providing a list of data.
  * BetaBinomialDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * BetaDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * ChineseRestaurantProcess: Now keeps track of total customers.
  * ExponentialDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * GammaDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * GeometricDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * LaplaceDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * MultinomialDistribution: Added logSize method.
  * MultivariateGaussian: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * NegativeBinomialDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * NormalInverseWishartDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * PoissonDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * ScalarDataDistribution: getDomain now returns in sorted order.
  * StudentTDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * UniformDistribution: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * UnivariateGaussian: Now implements EstimableDistribution.
  * ConfidenceIntervalEvaluator: Added computeConfidenceInterval method that
    takes a mean, variance, number of samples, and confidence. All existing
    ConfidenceIntervalEvaluators updated; which mostly meant changing static
    methods to be member methods and adding INSTANCE variables for those without
    parameters.
  * ChebyshevInequality: Now extends AbstractCloneableSerializable.
